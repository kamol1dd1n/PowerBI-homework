----
1. "Merge" as inner join on specific key(eg CustID) and "Append" just pastes two tables according to columns vertically, no key needed
2. In qery editor split column by delimeter and enter a space, choose left-most delimeter and ENTER
3. Used for pivoting columns
4. On the right bar, theres a window showing steps, click X and step is "undone"
5. Duplicate - fully copies an existing table, changes in original wouldnt change the Duplicate
Reference - generates from the output of the original, change in original's output will effect the reference table
