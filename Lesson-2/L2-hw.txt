2. To click on button get data on the home tab
3. Click refresh button on the tab
4. Excel(.xlsx) and CSV(.csv)
5. Shows a preview of the data source's contents
6. ...
7. Using "Transform data" on "Navigator" and going to Query editor to set specific datatype for each column
8. Load directly transfers the data to powerbi but using transform we can adjust datastructure, columns and etc. before even loading it
9. Having a spelling mistake in server or database name
10. Go to Query editor>Advanced editor then change the source of the file in the M-code
11. let
    Source = Csv.Document(File.Contents("[source]")),
    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(Source, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
    #"Filtered Rows" = Table.SelectRows(#"Promoted Headers", each [Quantity] > 1)
in
    #"Filtered Rows"
12. Go to advanced editor and update the file path
13. Go to transform and manually set new datatypes for the problematic columns
14. ...
15. In Power BI Service, we can publish the report
In Power Automate, creating a flow:
Using a trigger to schedule the import
Adding an action like "Refresh a dataset" (by Power BI connector), selecting the dataset in the workspace
Configure the flow to run at desired intervals (hourly, daily, weekly...)
Ensure the data source supports automatic refresh (cloud-based sources for example)
Save and test the flow to confirm the dataset refreshes as scheduled
